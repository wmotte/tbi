## Study background

The aim of the present study was to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of white matter injury with diffusion MRI, and to
elucidate its relationship to changes in sensorimotor function at different levels of traumatic brain injury.

### Methods

We induced mild or moderate TBI in 52 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats using the Marmarou weight-drop-model under isoflurane anesthesia. Fourteen animals underwent a sham procedure.
Diffusion-weighted MRI (4.7T; 2D multislice EPI; isotropic 0.5-mm voxels; b = 1282 s/mm 2 ; 60 diffusion-weighting directions) was done under isoflurane anesthesia prior to injury, and at 1h, 24h, one week, one month and three to four months after injury. 
Images were (non)-linearly registered to a 3D digital rat brain atlas.
Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), were calculated in various white and grey matter regions. Sensorimotor function was assessed from a sensorimotor deficit score and a beam walk test.
